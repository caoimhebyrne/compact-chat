## Compact Chat

**Compact Chat** is a mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) which will remove duplicate messages from your chat.

If a message is sent twice, the previous message will be removed, and the newer one will have the number of occurrences
appended to it.

> Make sure to check out the config for all available options.
> **(Requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)!)**
